# MarketDays
MarketDays is a trading application with real rewards.<br/> 
Spring cleaning? Take anything you don't want anymore, and take part in a daily local market trading session! <br/> <br/> 
Find items you want, and propose trades. Swap item cards throughout the day, and use them to find the perfect deal! <br/> <br/> 
Or just kick back, and watch offers come pouring in! At the end of the day, take your spring cleaning to the market location, and exchange your items! <br/> <br/> 
After all, "One man's trash is another man's treasure." <br/>
